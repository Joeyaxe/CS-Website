  <h1>How long does it take for a M and M shell to dissolve in hot water?</h1>
  <h2>How We Collected Our Data</h2>
  <p>First we started by opening a bag of M and Ms. Then we filled 3 cups full with really hot water and set them on the table.
    Then we took 1 M and M for each cup of water and put them in the cups of the water. 
    Then we started a timer as soon as we put the M and Ms in the cups of water. After that,
    we waited until we saw that the M and M shells were dissolved in the hot water.
    Finally we recorded the times that it took for the M and M shells to dissolve
    and put those times on a Google spreadhseet.

  <h2>How We Analysised Data</h2>
  <p>First we looked through all of our data on the Google spreadsheet. 
    Then we sorted all of the data from A to Z on the Google spreadsheet.
    After that we calculated the adverage of all of our data.
