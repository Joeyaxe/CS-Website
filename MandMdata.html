  <h1>How long does it take for a M and M shell to dissolve in hot water?</h1>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>First we started by opening a bag of M and Ms. Then we filled 3 cups full with really hot water and set them on the table.
    Then we took 1 M and M for each cup of water and put them in the cups of the water. 
    Then we started a timer as soon as we put the M and Ms in the cups of water. After that,
    we waited until we saw that the M and M shells were dissolved in the hot water.
    Finally we recorded the times that it took for the M and M shells to dissolve
    and put those times on a Google spreadhseet.</p>
